Task 4: SQL for Data Analysis
üéØ Objective

Use SQL queries to extract and analyze data from an E-commerce database.

üß† Tools Used

MySQL Command Line Client

üìä Dataset

Created two sample tables:

Orders

Customers

ü™ú Queries Performed

SELECT & WHERE ‚Äì Filter orders by region.

ORDER BY ‚Äì Sort orders by price.

GROUP BY & SUM() ‚Äì Total sales by category.

AVG() ‚Äì Average sales by region.

Subquery ‚Äì Find customers who spent above average.

JOIN ‚Äì Combine orders with customer cities.

VIEW ‚Äì Create reusable high-value order view.

üñºÔ∏è Deliverables

SQL file: Task4_SQL_Queries.sql

Screenshots of queries and results

üí° Outcome

Learned to query structured data using SQL, apply joins, subqueries, and create views for analysis.

üóÇÔ∏è Interview Questions and Answers
1Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?

WHERE filters rows before grouping (with GROUP BY).

HAVING filters groups after grouping.
Example:
SELECT region, SUM(price)
FROM orders
GROUP BY region
HAVING SUM(price) > 10000;
2Ô∏è‚É£ What are the different types of JOINS?

INNER JOIN ‚Äì returns matching rows from both tables.

LEFT JOIN ‚Äì returns all rows from the left table and matching ones from the right.

RIGHT JOIN ‚Äì returns all rows from the right table and matching ones from the left.

FULL JOIN ‚Äì returns all rows when there is a match in either table.
3Ô∏è‚É£ How do you calculate average revenue per user in SQL?
SELECT customer_name, AVG(price) AS avg_revenue
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_name;


This calculates the average amount each customer spends.

4Ô∏è‚É£ What are subqueries?

A subquery is a query inside another query.
It‚Äôs used when you need to use results from one query in another.
Example:

SELECT customer_name, price
FROM orders
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM orders);

5Ô∏è‚É£ How do you optimize a SQL query?

Use indexes on frequently searched columns.

Avoid SELECT *; choose only required columns.

Use joins instead of multiple subqueries where possible.

Analyze query performance with EXPLAIN.

6Ô∏è‚É£ What is a VIEW in SQL?

A View is a saved virtual table based on a query.
It helps simplify complex queries and improve readability.
Example:

CREATE VIEW high_value_orders AS
SELECT customer_name, price FROM orders WHERE price > 10000;

7Ô∏è‚É£ How would you handle NULL values in SQL?

Use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL to check for nulls.

Replace NULLs with another value using COALESCE() or IFNULL().
Example:

SELECT COALESCE(price, 0) FROM orders;

üåü Summary

This task helped me:

Create and manage databases in MySQL.

Use key SQL commands (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, JOINS, VIEWS).

Analyze structured data efficiently and interpret business insights.
